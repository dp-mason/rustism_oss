// lfoOne and lfoTwo are the current values (-10 to 10) of two "Low Frequency Oscillators",
// waves that can be used to change certain factors over time. for example, amplitude.
// Changing the amplitude would make the wave louder and quieter over time. Think of it like
// automatically turning the volume knob up and down according to a slow sine wave.

// "Modulation" is the word typically used to describe these sorts of procedural changes

// the frequency is taken care of for you, but is is also provided here in hertz if you would
// like the synth behvior to change (modulate) according the frequency it is generating
